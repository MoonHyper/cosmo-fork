# Cosmo

Cosmo is a statically-typed programming language written in pure Crystal.<br>
We have an [extension for VS code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cosmo.vscode-cosmo) ([source](https://github.com/R-unic/vscode-cosmo)), however it currently only features syntax highlighting.

## Things I Gotta Do

- Arrays
- Some sorta hashmap
- Interfaces
- Classes
  * single inheritance
  * mixins
  * visibilities
  * methods
  * $ (this)
- Better type system
  * unions/intersections

## Installation

1. Install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/).
2. Run `sudo make install`.
3. Assert everything is working by running `cosmo -h`
